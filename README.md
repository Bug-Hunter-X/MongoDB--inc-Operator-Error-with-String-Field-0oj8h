# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Field

This example demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB related to the misuse of the `$inc` operator. The `$inc` operator is used to increment numerical values in documents, but attempting to use it on a string field will throw an error.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage, leading to an error. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach, either by ensuring that the field is numeric or by using a different operator for string manipulation.
